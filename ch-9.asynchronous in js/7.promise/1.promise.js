// To overcome callback hell, you can use Promises. Promises provide a cleaner and more manageable way to handle asynchronous operations by chaining .then() and handling errors with .catch(). This improves readability and maintains vertical code flow instead of horizontal nesting.

// the promise object represents the eventual completion (or failure) of an asynchronous operation and its resulting value

// promise as an object that links producing code and consuming code

// In JavaScript, a promise is a good way to handle asynchronous operations. It is used to find out if the asynchronous operation is successfully completed or not.

// A promise may have one of three states.

// Pending
// Fulfilled
// Rejected

// To create a promise object, we use the Promise() constructor.

// let promise = new Promise(function(resolve, reject){
// do something
// });

// The Promise() constructor takes a function as an argument. The function also accepts two functions resolve() and reject().

// If the promise returns successfully, the resolve() function is called. And, if an error occurs, the reject() function is called.

// example

const paymentDetails = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
  console.log("payment initialized");
  setTimeout(() => {
    console.log("checking payment details...");
  }, 2000);

  let payment = true;

  setTimeout(() => {
    if (payment === true) {
      resolve("payment successful completed");
    } else {
      reject("payment failed");
    }
  }, 3000);
});

// the above code is promise producing code

// and the below code is promise consuming code

paymentDetails
  .then((message) => {
    console.log("success :", message);
  })
  .then(() => {
    console.log("quit now");
  }).then(()=>{
    
  });

paymentDetails.catch((err) => {
  console.log("reject :", err);
});
