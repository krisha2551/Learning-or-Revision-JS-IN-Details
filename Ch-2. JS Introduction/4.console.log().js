// Using console.log(), we can print values to the browser console in JavaScript.

// Using console.log(), we can also debug our code by checking the output or identifying issues.

// Example of console.log():

console.log("shivam"); // This will print "shivam" as a string, which will be visible in the browser's console, not on the web page itself.
