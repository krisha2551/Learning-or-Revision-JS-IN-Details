// In JavaScript, an IIFE (Immediately Invoked Function Expression) is a function that runs immediately after its declaration.

// In an IIFE, we have to add two parentheses: one for the function definition and one for invocation.

(function iife() {
  console.log("this is an immediate invoke function expression");
