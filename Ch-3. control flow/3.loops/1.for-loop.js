// In programming, a loop is used to perform a task repeatedly.

// JavaScript has five types of loops, which vary based on the condition.

// 1. For Loop

// In JavaScript, the 'for' loop is used for iterating over a block of code a certain number of times,
// or for iterating over the elements of an array.

// Example: Printing numbers from 0 to 99

for (let i = 0; i < 100; i++) {
  console.log(i);
}

// This code will print numbers from 0 to 99.

// Example: Iterating over the elements of an array

let fruits = ["apple", "orange", "banana", "peach", "mango", "cherry"];

for (let i = 0; i < fruits.length; i++) {
  console.log(fruits[i]);
}

// This code will print each element in the 'fruits' array.
